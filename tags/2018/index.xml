      <description>Recently, it had become abundantly clear that I needed a home lab. I have seen some amazing home lab builds around the internet and am in awe of most of them. Multiple physical hosts, physical switches, external storage, and in some cases complete HCI setups. This is what I wanted. This is what I needed! However, I am extraordinarily cheap, and spending that kind of money on a lab might give me a heart attack and if I survived that my wife might kill me anyways!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that the selection process is complete, I need to put it all together and get it all setup.
This process will include setting up my &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; environment, configuration of GitHub Pages, and configuration of a custom URL.
Upon completion of these steps, I will be ready to start publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selecting My Blogging Platform</title>
      <link>https://interruptrequest.io/2018/07/02/selecting-my-blogging-platform/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I have selected my name, I had to select a platform to publish on.
I looked at several options including &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, and a few others.
WordPress was the front runner for a while, but what I really wanted was a simplistic method to host static pages, version control, create and edit content anywhere, support for a custom domain name, and as free as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I have been looking to start a site \ blog to share with the world my technological learnings and insights.
One of the hardest things I had to figure out was what to call the site.
I wanted something that would be easy to remember, unique, and most importantly not already taken.
Considering all these requirements, I spent over a year attempting to figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;
