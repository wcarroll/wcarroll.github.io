      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week, I had the amazing opportunity to speak at two different VMUG events.
The first group I got to speak with was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.vmug.com/communities/localcommunityhome?CommunityKey=48abd35e-f8de-4128-8e25-3fdffdbac9be&#34;&gt;Columbia, SC VMUG&lt;/a&gt; and the second was with the Hilton Head / Bluffton, SC VMUG group.
Both of these events had some very smart people in the room which led to quite interesting conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
